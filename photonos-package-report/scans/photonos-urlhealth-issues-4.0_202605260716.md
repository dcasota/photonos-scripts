## 1. Source URL Blank / Macro Unresolved (UrlHealth=blank)

The Source0 URL contains unexpanded RPM macros or is empty.

| # | Spec | Name | Source0 Original | Fix Suggestion |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | chromium.spec | chromium | `https://github.com/chromium/chromium/archive/%{name}-%{version}.tar.xz` | Verify Source0 URL macro expansion. The %{version} or %{name} macro may not resolve. Provide a direct URL or fix the macro. |
| 2 | raspberrypi-firmware.spec | raspberrypi-firmware | `%{name}-%{version}.tar.gz` | Verify Source0 URL macro expansion. The %{version} or %{name} macro may not resolve. Provide a direct URL or fix the macro. |

## 2. URL Substitution Unfinished

| # | Spec | Name | Source0 Original | Modified Source0 | Fix Suggestion |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | dhcp.spec | dhcp | `ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/dhcp/${version}/%{name}-%{version}.tar.gz` | `` | Fix the Source0 URL pattern. The version/name substitution is incomplete -- check for nested or malformed macros. |
