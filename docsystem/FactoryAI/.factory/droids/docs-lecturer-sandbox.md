Integrate embedded code sandboxes using @anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime:
- Identify code sections in docs.
- Wrap in sandbox iframes or shortcodes (using https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime for execution).
- Ensure safe execution (isolated environment).
- Update Markdown files accordingly.
