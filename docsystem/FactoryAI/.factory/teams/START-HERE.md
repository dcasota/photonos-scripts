## 🎓 Learning Path

### 5 Minutes
1. Read this file ✓
2. Skim [STRUCTURE.txt](STRUCTURE.txt)
3. Try running: `factory run @docs-maintenance-orchestrator`

### 15 Minutes
1. Read [README.md](README.md)
2. Review [SUMMARY.md](SUMMARY.md)
3. Explore one team directory

### 30 Minutes
1. Complete 15-minute path
2. Read [BEFORE-AFTER.md](BEFORE-AFTER.md)
3. Review all three team READMEs

### 1 Hour
1. Complete 30-minute path
2. Read [MIGRATION-GUIDE.md](MIGRATION-GUIDE.md)
3. Review orchestrator files
4. Test all three teams

## 🔧 Common Tasks

### "I want to fix broken links"
```bash
factory run @docs-maintenance-crawler
factory run @docs-maintenance-auditor
factory run @docs-maintenance-editor
```

### "I want to modernize code blocks"
```bash
factory run @docs-sandbox-orchestrator
```

### "I want to add translation support"
```bash
factory run @docs-translator-orchestrator
```

### "I want to run everything"
```bash
factory run @DocsSwarmMasterOrchestrator
```

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Teams Execute Sequentially
```
Maintenance → Sandbox → Translator
(Quality First) (Modernize) (Globalize)
```

### Quality Gates Between Teams
Each team must meet quality standards before the next team starts.

### Independent Team Testing
You can test and debug each team independently.
